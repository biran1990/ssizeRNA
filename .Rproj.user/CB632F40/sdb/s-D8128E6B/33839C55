Our\n    procedure depends on the Voom method proposed for RNA-seq data analysis\n    by Law et al. (2014) and the sample size calculation method proposed for\n    microarray experiments by Liu and Hwang (2007). We develop a set of functions\n    that calculates appropriate sample sizes for two-sample t-test for RNA-seq\n    experiments with fixed or varied set of parameters. The outputs also contain a\n    plot of power versus sample size, a table of power at different sample sizes,\n    and a table of critical test values at different sample sizes. \n    To install this package, please use \n    \"source('http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R'); biocLite('ssizeRNA')\".\nDepends:\n    R (>= 3.2.0)\nImports:\n    MASS,\n    Biobase,\n    edgeR,\n    limma,\n    qvalue,\n    ssize.fdr\nVignetteBuilder: knitr\nSuggests: BiocStyle, knitr\nLicense: GPL (>= 2)\nbiocViews: GeneExpression, DifferentialExpression, ExperimentalDesign,\n    Sequencing, RNASeq, DNASeq, Microarray\nRoxygenNote: 5.0.1\n",
